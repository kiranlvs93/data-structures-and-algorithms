Types of Data Structures
    Physical DS - Array, List
    Logical DS - Hash, Stack, Graph, Queues, Tress
Big O Notation
* This is used to measure the time or space complexity
* Time complexity is the measure of time taken for algorithms to execute with the increase in input size
* O(1) - Constant time complexity - The execution time is constant irrespective of the input size. This is best time complexity
* O(N) - Linear time complexity - The execution time is proportional to the input size.
* O(N^2) - The execution time increases exponentially with the increase in input size.

Asymptotic analysis : Study of behaviour of a function f(N) as N tends to infinity
So, the below is true in asymptotic analysis, because as N tends to infinity, N and 1 become insignificant compared to N^2 
`O(N^2+N+1) = O(N^2)`
